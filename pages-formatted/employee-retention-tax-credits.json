It included two programs to assist businesses with keeping workers employed: the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) administered by the Small Business Adminstration and Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERTC) administered by the Internal Revenue Service.\nPPP funds are distributed based on 2.5 months of payroll and a minimum of 80% of the funds must be used on payroll to be eligible for forgiveness. Additionally, PPP funds are not taxable as revenue and you may still take deductions for the payroll covered by PPP.\nERTC tax credits, however, are credits (or refunds) for a percentage of payroll in each quarter that you qualify. There are specific rules for determining eligibility by quarter, and limiting the dollars that can be claimed for each employee.\nERC eligibility requirements\nWhat are “qualified wages” and how to claim credits?\nHow does the number of employees factor into the ERC?\nI got PPP funds already. Can I also get ERTC?\nHow do I apply for ERTC tax credits?\nMy revenue in Q1 2021 is back to pre-pandemic levels - so I must be ineligible - right?\nI thought payroll taxes deferred in 2020 had to be re-paid. Does ERTC work the same way?\nWhy isn't my bank talking about this?\nWill my Tax CPA handle this for me since they handle my income tax returns?\nWhat about my Payroll Service Provider? Shouldn't they be on top of this?\nWhy did the IRS issue a warning about 3rd party processing companies?\nHow long does the IRS have to audit my ERC?\nAre there any restrictions on how I can spend my ERC refund?\nBrowse All FAQ's"
