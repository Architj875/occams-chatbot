Through the founder’s own entrepreneurial experiences, as well as from client feedback, Occams Advisory was created, from day one, to serve the small business market by addressing the most pressing needs of entrepreneurs.\n\nOur name is inspired by the principle of Occams Razor, propounded by William of Occam (1288-1348 AD), an English Franciscan friar and scholastic philosopher. Occams Razor is a line of reasoning that says the simplest answer is often correct. Occams Advisory uses this spirit of problem-solving to provide simple solutions to complex problems, focusing on tangible results, measurable impact and continuous improvement.\n\nLet's Partner\nOur Philosophies\n\n“Through our observations and learnings, we have created a logical and sequential O.C.C.A.M.S set of Values and Principles, across Emotional, Intellectual and Physical dimensions that human beings operate in. Our beliefs are grounded in latest and most advanced scientific research that explore the effects that emotions have on our entire being originating from cells in particular, on our chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA. Leading scientists and neurologists have aligned to conclude that our emotions can shape our physical reality at the molecular level. Hence, we at Occams emphasize upon Emotions: Feelings as the single most critical building block of Intellect: Thinking which drives and executes our Physical: Being.\n\nClick on the Trinity of O.C.C.A.M.S. philosophies that lay out our model of an ideal individual, intellectual and professional.”\n\nEmotional:\nFeeling\nOwnership\n\nRead More\n\nClarity\n\nRead More\n\nConnection\n\nRead More\n\nAppreciation\n\nRead More\n\nManage\n\nRead More\n\nServe\n\nRead More\n\nIntellectual:\nThinking\nOutcome\n\nRead More\n\nCuriosity\n\nRead More\n\nCommitment\n\nRead More\n\nAnticipation\n\nRead More\n\nMeasure\n\nRead More\n\nSeek\n\nRead More\n\nPhysical:\nBeing\nOwnership\n\nRead More\n\nContext\n\nRead More\n\nCommunication\n\nRead More\n\nAction\n\nRead More\n\nMetrics\n\nRead More\n\nSimplify\n\nRead More\n\nOur Impact\n\nIn a world where over a billion people suffer from malnutrition, and even more lack access to clean water, the challenges are immense. About one child in every five receives no education and is at risk. With the world's population set to grow by at least two billion over the next three decades, primarily in the developing world, these challenges can compound. At Occams Advisory, we take the right action by partnering with organizations like blossomprojects.org to implement preventative and remedial steps, working toward a brighter future for all.\n\n\n\nKnow More\nJoin Our Community"
